# Research

This is a research repository for exploring ideas, testing hypotheses, and running code experiments with the help of coding agents.

## What is this?

This repository follows the pattern described in Simon Willison's blog post [Asynchronous code research with coding agents](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/). It's a dedicated space where coding agents can:

- Build proof-of-concepts to answer technical questions
- Run performance benchmarks and comparisons
- Explore new libraries and technologies
- Create experimental prototypes
- Test whether specific approaches are viable

Each subdirectory contains a separate research project with its own README documenting what was explored and what was learned.

## Why a dedicated repository?

Having a separate repository for research projects offers several advantages:

- **Freedom to experiment**: Not limited to existing codebases
- **Fewer constraints**: Can install any dependencies and access the network freely
- **Clean separation**: Research code stays separate from production code
- **Lower stakes**: Agents can be more autonomous without risking sensitive code

## Research Projects

_Projects will be added as they are completed._

## Philosophy

The great thing about questions about code is that they can often be definitively answered by writing and executing code. When coding agents write and execute code that demonstrates something works, they've proven it's possible—even if they make mistakes along the way, the code itself doesn't lie.

This repository is for quick, focused research tasks that typically take 10-30 minutes of agent time to complete.
